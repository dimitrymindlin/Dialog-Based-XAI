# Dialog-Based-XAI

## Purpose
Collection of links to dialog based XAI systems

## Implemented Systems (🔐 = No public code, 👐 = public code)

- Explainable AI through Rule-based Interactive Conversation 🔐
    - “A first prototype of ERIC is implemented using the rule-based programming
    language **CLIPS** and a **Python** interface revealing promising results.”
- [TalkToModel](https://github.com/dylan-slack/TalkToModel) 👐
    - `Based on:` *Rethinking Explainability as a Dialogue: A Practitioner's Perspective*
- [Model Studio](https://github.com/ModelOriented/modelStudio) (dashboard) *The Grammar of Interactive Explanatory Model Analysis* 👐
- [XAI-bot](https://github.com/ModelOriented/xaibot/blob/master/xaibot2.gif) open source project of a bot for XAI
    - The chatbot is based on [dialog-flow](https://dialogflow.com/) google infrastructure. It communicates with [DALEX explainers](https://github.com/pbiecek/DALEX/) written in R through [plumber REST API](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/rendering-and-output.html).
    - Find the chatbot here: [https://kmichael08.github.io](https://kmichael08.github.io/).
    - `Based on:` *What Would You Ask the Machine Learning Model? Identification of User Needs for Model Explanations Based on Human-Model Conversations*
- **Sokol, Flach:** *Glass-Box: Explaining AI Decisions With Counterfactual Statements Through Conversation With a Voice-enabled Virtual Assistant* 🔐
    
    `Based on:` **Sokol, Flach:** *Explainability Fact Sheets: A Framework for Systematic Assessment of Explainable Approaches*
