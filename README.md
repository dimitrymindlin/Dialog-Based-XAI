# Dialog-Based-XAI

## Purpose
Collection of links to dialog based XAI systems

## Implemented Systems (👐 = open source, 🔐 = No public code)

- 👐 [X-Agent](https://github.com/bach1292/XAGENT)
    - `Based on:` [Nguyen, Van Bach, Jörg Schlötterer, and Christin Seifert. "Explaining Machine Learning Models in Natural Conversations: Towards a Conversational XAI Agent." arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.02552 (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02552.pdf)
- 👐 [TalkToModel](https://github.com/dylan-slack/TalkToModel)
    - `Based on:` [Slack, Dylan, et al. "TalkToModel: Understanding Machine Learning Models With Open Ended Dialogues." arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.04154 (2022)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04154)
    - `Preceeding Paper:` [Rethinking Explainability as a Dialogue: A Practitioner's Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01875)
- 👐 [ERIC: Explainable AI through Rule-based Interactive Conversation](https://github.com/viadee/eric/blob/master/README.md)  
    - `Based on:` [Werner, Christian. "Explainable AI through Rule-based Interactive Conversation." Edbt/icdt workshops. 2020.](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2578/ETMLP3.pdf) very short, was a master thesis 
    - [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3bsM33oBtY) for the system usage
- 👐 [Model Studio](https://github.com/ModelOriented/modelStudio) 
    - primerely a dashboard, yet the authors talk about integrating that in a dialog scenario ... check paper

    - `Following Work:` [The Grammar of Interactive Explanatory Model Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00497)
-  👐 [XAI-bot](https://github.com/ModelOriented/xaibot/blob/master/xaibot2.gif)
    - "The chatbot is based on [dialog-flow](https://dialogflow.com/) google infrastructure. It communicates with [DALEX explainers](https://github.com/pbiecek/DALEX/) written in R through [plumber REST API](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/rendering-and-output.html)."
