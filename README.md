# Dialog-Based-XAI

## Purpose
Collection of links to dialog based XAI systems

## Implemented Systems (👐 = open source, 🔐 = No public code)

- 👐 [X-Agent](https://github.com/bach1292/XAGENT)
    - `Based on:` [Explaining Machine Learning Models in Natural Conversations: Towards a Conversational XAI Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02552.pdf)
- 👐 [TalkToModel](https://github.com/dylan-slack/TalkToModel)
    - `Based on:` [TalkToModel: Understanding Machine Learning Models With Open Ended Dialogues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04154)
    - `Preceeding Paper:` [Rethinking Explainability as a Dialogue: A Practitioner's Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04154.pdf)
- 👐 [ERIC: Explainable AI through Rule-based Interactive Conversation](https://github.com/viadee/eric/blob/master/README.md)  
    - [Paper](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2578/ETMLP3.pdf) very short, was a master thesis 
    - [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3bsM33oBtY) for the system usage
- 👐 [Model Studio](https://github.com/ModelOriented/modelStudio) 
    - primerely a dashboard, yet the authors talk about integrating that in a dialog scenario ... check paper 
    - `Based on:` [modelStudio: Interactive Studio with Explanations for
ML Predictive Models](https://www.theoj.org/joss-papers/joss.01798/10.21105.joss.01798.pdf)
    - `Following Work:` [The Grammar of Interactive Explanatory Model Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00497)
-  👐 [XAI-bot](https://github.com/ModelOriented/xaibot/blob/master/xaibot2.gif)
    - "The chatbot is based on [dialog-flow](https://dialogflow.com/) google infrastructure. It communicates with [DALEX explainers](https://github.com/pbiecek/DALEX/) written in R through [plumber REST API](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/rendering-and-output.html)."
    - Find the chatbot here: [https://kmichael08.github.io](https://kmichael08.github.io/).
    - `Based on:` [What Would You Ask the Machine Learning Model? Identification of User Needs for Model Explanations Based on Human-Model Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05674)
- 🔐 [Glass-Box: Explaining AI Decisions With Counterfactual Statements Through Conversation With a Voice-enabled Virtual Assistant](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0865.pdf) 
    - `Preceeding Paper:` **Sokol, Flach:** [Explainability Fact Sheets: A Framework for Systematic Assessment of Explainable Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05100)
    - `Preceeding Paper:` **Sokol, Flach:** [One Explanation Does Not Fit All The Promise of Interactive Explanations for Machine Learning Transparency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09734)
