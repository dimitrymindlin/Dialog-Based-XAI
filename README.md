# Dialog-Based-XAI

## Purpose
Collection of links to dialog based XAI systems

## Implemented Systems (🔐 = No public code, 👐 = public code)

- [TalkToModel](https://github.com/dylan-slack/TalkToModel) 👐
    - `Based on:` [TalkToModel: Understanding Machine Learning Models With Open Ended Dialogues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04154)
    - `Preceeding Paper:` [Rethinking Explainability as a Dialogue: A Practitioner's Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04154.pdf)
- [Model Studio](https://github.com/ModelOriented/modelStudio) 👐 (dashboard) 
    - `Based on:` [The Grammar of Interactive Explanatory Model Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00497) 👐
- [XAI-bot](https://github.com/ModelOriented/xaibot/blob/master/xaibot2.gif) 👐
    - "The chatbot is based on [dialog-flow](https://dialogflow.com/) google infrastructure. It communicates with [DALEX explainers](https://github.com/pbiecek/DALEX/) written in R through [plumber REST API](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/rendering-and-output.html)."
    - Find the chatbot here: [https://kmichael08.github.io](https://kmichael08.github.io/).
    - `Based on:` [What Would You Ask the Machine Learning Model? Identification of User Needs for Model Explanations Based on Human-Model Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05674)
    
- Explainable AI through Rule-based Interactive Conversation 🔐
    - “A first prototype of ERIC is implemented using the rule-based programming
    language **CLIPS** and a **Python** interface revealing promising results.”
